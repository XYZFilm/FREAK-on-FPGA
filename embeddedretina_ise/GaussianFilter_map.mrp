  Number of Slice Registers:                   573 out of 106,400    1%

      Number used as Shift Register:             0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          764
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           192 out of     764   25%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 237 out of     764   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         335 out of     764   43%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               9 out of 106,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   2

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "CLK" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "CLK" is not constrained (LOC) to a specific
   location.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 136 block(s) removed
   3 block(s) optimized away
 136 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
